Quick and dirty test to introduce graphical signatures in office documents
and upload them to sharepoint 2007
the project was actually never finished and only excel and doc (both 2007 and 2010 formats) are supported
no powerpoint or other stuff
no TDD sorry
To make it work, you will need to put the refernces to the dlls containing the SharePoint 2007 object model
This was originally done around the second half of 2009...approx
Originally a VS 2008 project, now migrated to 2010
